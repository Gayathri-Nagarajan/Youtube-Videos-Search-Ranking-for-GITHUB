We layered the meat &amp; cheese together &amp; placed small stick sizes of yellow orange &amp; red bell peppers &amp; super small baby carrots on top of the meat &amp; cheese then rolled them all up. I’d though of cutting them in the sushi shape but decided to leave them as roll ups.  I’ll let you know how they went over at the party.

Those countries have one of the longest longevity in the world. When people say to avoid soy products, I am just confused. As long as it’s non GMO, shouldn’t they be healthy?
